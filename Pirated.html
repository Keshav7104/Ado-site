                The object of the Hunt is to have fun. The one thing nobody wants to happen is
                for a team to be in an accident. Any incident  
                during the Hunt resulting in injury or worse may mean the end of the Hunt.
                Recognize that success of the Hunt is designed to be based upon clue
                complexity and your ability to solve them.Win
                through being prepared, not speeding. The following rules are in the interest of
                safety. Random spot checks will be done at certain sites by Hunt coordinators.
                If there is any sign of reckless behaviour as judged by a Hunt coordinator, that
                team will be disqualified and may not be allowed in future Hunts. All decisions
                in this matter will be final!</p>
